Fix bugs:
o Propagate types down to generated procs
   Plan:  (a) ensure generated procs are in same SCC as their other part
          (b) where different parts of a proc call each other,
              propagate type info both ways
o Module qualification doesn't work right.  Currently any module
   qualifier must give the module that defines the item, not the
   module it was imported from.  This is currently masked by the fact
   that the parser can't handle module specs at all.   


Complete the implementation:
o Fix algebraic type implementation to use tags
o Code generation


Improve error handling:
o Give meaningful message for errors detected in generated procs


Complete the language:
o Support polymorphism
o Support subtypes
o Support higher-order programming
o Support declared laziness
o Support optional and named arguments


Optimise:
o Remove unneeded input and unchanged output arguments
o Inline local procs with only one call
o Common sub-expression elimination
o Constant folding
o Destructive update transformation (CTGC)
