Fix bugs:


Complete the implementation:
o Support multiple non-constant constructors
o Implied modes:  transform expression version of proc call with inputs where
  outputs are expected into proc call plus equality tests
o Ensure a variable both assigned and used in a statement has the assignment
  happen first, wherever it appears in the statement
o Unifications:  transform f(?x,?y) = z into test f(?x,?y,z)

Error checking:
o Error if foreign call has no outputs; suggest use !I/O.
o Ensure no statement binds the same variable multiple times

Improve error handling:
o Give meaningful message for errors detected in generated procs
o Detect and report use of uninitialised variables, including update
   of uninitialised variables

Complete the language:
o Support higher order procs and functions through multiple specialisation
o Provide switch-on-constructor syntax and implementation
o Fix the syntax!
    o At expression level, support infix ops, where the ops are sequences of
      operator characters
    o At statement level, support brace-enclosed statement sequence as statement
    o Interpolation (string and array)
        o "...@foo..." = "..." ++ foo ++ "..."
	o "...@(foo(bar,baz))..." = "..." ++ foo(bar,baz) ++ "..."
	o [foo,@bar(baz),zip] = [foo] ++ bar(baz) ++ [zip]
	o if ++ can run backwards, then [?foo,@?bar] and [@?foo,bar] can be patterns
	o with this, no need for [ ... | ...] syntax
o Support polymorphism
o Support subtypes
o Support generators (lazy lists)
o Support declared laziness through multiple specialisation
o Support optional and named arguments


Optimise:
o More foreign primitive optimisation:  or with 0, unsigned > 1, etc.
o Remove unneeded input and unchanged output arguments
o Inter-procedure common sub-expression elimination
o Code hoisting
o Destructive update transformation (CTGC)


Blocks:
o Improve Logging to be distributable
o add Procedure id for global module level procedures
o Insert target triple into the definition of LLVMAST.Module during
  creation.

Emit:
o Improve Logging

Make:
o Add creation of cabal sandbox and dependency install
