Fix bugs:
o Ensure every variable gets a type
o Propagate types down to generated procs
   Plan:  (a) ensure generated procs are in same SCC as their other part
          (b) where different parts of a proc call each other,
              propagate type info both ways


Complete the implementation:
o Fix algebraic type implementation to use tags
o Code generation


Improve error handling:
o Attach expression reference to generated variables for use in error messages
o Give meaningful message for errors detected in generated procs


Complete the language:
o Implement resources
  Plan: Do type inference ignoring resources, then do separate
        resource-intro pass
o Support polymorphism
o Support subtypes
o Support higher-order programming
o Support declared laziness
o Support optional and named arguments


Optimise:
o Remove unneeded input and unchanged output arguments
o Inline local procs with only one call
o Common sub-expression elimination
o Constant folding
o Destructive update transformation (CTGC)
