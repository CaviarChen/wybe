--------
1. Installing LLVM on OSX
2. Configuring and Installing dependencies for Wybe
3. Installing Haskell Package `llvm-general` from its source with cabal


0. Ensure XCode is installed (needs to be redone after OS upgrade):

      xcode-select --install


1. INSTALLING LLVM ON OSX
-------------------------
Required version: 3.5.x.x.

1. Using Homebrew:
      brew install llvm35 --with-all-targets

   If this fails, you may need to instead do:
      brew install homebrew/versions/llvm35 --with-all-targets

2. Ensure '/usr/local/opt/llvm35/bin/' is in your PATH so that the Haskell
   package `llvm-general` can find the binary `llvm-config-3.5`. This way you
   can keep multiple LLVM versions installed.


2. CONFIGURE AND INSTALLING DEPENDENCIES FOR WYBE
-------------------------------------------------
Sandbox can be avoided to make things simpler. In the project directory:

        cabal configure
        cabal install --only-dependencies


It would probably fail at installing `llvm-general-3.5.1.0`, which would have
to installed separately through it's github source.

Using cabal to build and run, alternatively to make:

      cabal build
      cabal run


3. INSTALLING HASKELL PACKAGE `llvm-general` FROM ITS SOURCE WITH CABAL
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Required version: 3.5.1.0.
In the project directory, `cabal list llvm-general` should give an overview on
which `llvm-general` version is installed or available. Unfortunately,
currently the `llvm-general-3.5.1.0` package on Hackage is not working with a
simple `cabal install llvm-general-3.5.1.0`.

Therefore, `llvm-general-3.5.1.0` should be installed through it's git
repository:

1. Clone the repository somewhere:

         git clone https://github.com/bscarlet/llvm-general

2. Switch to the branch `llvm-3.5` and install. This will install the package
   `llvm-general-3.5.1.0` and `llvm-general-pure-3.5.0.0` in the user level
   cabal package repository (~/.cabal..):

        git checkout llvm-3.5
        cd llvm-general
        cabal install -fshared-llvm
