Frege notes

** learn relational algebra!!!

atomic terms:  symbols, numbers

a term <t1, ..., tn> is a tuple of arity n

a term {t1, ..., tn} is a set

a relation of arity n is set of tuples of arity n

tuple operations:  car, cdr, cons, nil

set operations:  {}, {x} (singleton), union, intersection

Partial application:  if p is a relation and x is a term,
p x = \bigcup \{ f x t \| t \in p\} where
f x t = if (car t) == x then {cdr t} else {}

Partial application:  if p is a relation and x is a variable,
p x = ... need to keep all of p, and remember 1st argument is x


false = {}; true = {nil}






A predicate definition specifies a relation

A function of arity n is a relation of arity n+1 which has only one tuple for
each initial n arguments
